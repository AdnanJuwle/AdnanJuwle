## 🛠️ Current Projects

### 🌱 AI-Controlled Soil Analysis Rover (Leader)
> An interdisciplinary collaboration with the Mechanical Department  
- AI-powered autonomous rover extracts and analyzes soil samples  
- Uses IoT-based sensors and ML models for near-lab-quality predictions  
- Field data collection, sensor integration, and custom dataset creation  
- Exploring college-backed funding and future paper publication

### 🧠 Kamil – AI Operating System Assistant
> Personal AI assistant to control my laptop using human-brain-like architecture  
- Prompt-based execution: “Kamil, build a soil ML model” → model built, executed, accuracy shown  
- Locally-run LLMs with modular specializations for tasks (NLP, coding, filesystem, etc.)  
- Inspired by AGI modularity and custom multi-agent architecture
